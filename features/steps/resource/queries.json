        "Lacan's text": "Thus the erectile organ comes to symbolize the place of jouissance [ecstasy], not in itself, or even in the form of an image, but as a part lacking in the desired image: that is why it is equivalent to the square root of -1 of the signification produced above, of the jouissance that it restores by the coefficient of its statement to the function of lack of signifier (-1).", 
        "Trump's tweet": "We need Courageous JUSTICE in our Country. If the Courts don't allow what we have been allowed to do for 250 years, America can no longer be the same. Crooked Joe Biden will have destroyed our Country with his Open Border MADNESS, and allowing criminals of every type to enter with no Retribution.\nMurderers, Drug Dealers, Gang Members, and even the Mentally Insane will make their home in our Country, wreaking havoc like we have never seen before. It is not possible to have trials for millions and millions of people.\nWe know who the Criminals are, and we must get them out of the U.S.A. — and FAST!",
        "transparent white": "Given common usage of the word, something transparent can be green, but not white. Transparency and specular brilliance exist only in the depth dimension of the visual image. The impression one gets from a transparent medium is that there is something behind it. This can be said of both a green surface and a green transparent object, since being green means reflecting or transmitting only green light, but transparent white is not appropriate, since a white surface reflects all light, whereas an object that transmits all colors of light is simply called transparent.",
        "DHMO": "Each year, Dihydrogen Monoxide is a known causative component in many thousands of deaths and is a major contributor to millions upon millions of dollars in damage to property and the environment. Some of the known perils of Dihydrogen Monoxide are:\n￼* Death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO, even in small quantities.\n* Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage.\n* Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant though not typically life-threatening side-effects.\n* DHMO is a major component of acid rain.\n* Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns.\n* Contributes to soil erosion.\n* Leads to corrosion and oxidation of many metals.\n* Contamination of electrical systems often causes short-circuits.\n* Exposure decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes.\n* Found in biopsies of pre-cancerous tumors and lesions.\n* Given to vicious dogs involved in recent deadly attacks.\n* Often associated with killer cyclones in the U.S. Midwest and elsewhere, and in hurricanes including deadly storms in Florida, New Orleans and other areas of the southeastern U.S.\n* Thermal variations in DHMO are a suspected contributor to the El Niño weather effect.\nThus strong regulation for the production and use of DHMO is necessary.",
